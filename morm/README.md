# Model ORM

This is a refinement of the ModelBucket from weave/orm.
I am testing it out here to ease development of the models
in tutorial, but this should be merged into the main weave codebase.

You can see here how all parts of weave (including orm, middleware, etc)
are extensible in third-party packages. But if you don't like
looking under the hood, you can ignore this package.
